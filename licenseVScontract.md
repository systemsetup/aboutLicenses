# License Vs. Contract is important because laws around them are different.

| License                        | Contract                                  |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **NO** bargain for exchange.   | **Cannot Revoke** other party's right.    |
| There are stated requirements. | Else, breach of contract and pay damages. |

## Two states of license requirements

| Comply                                                       | Not Comply                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| _authority to undertake specified action under the license._ | _authority is not granted or revoked._ |
|                           | if _revoked_ its often without recourse (no remedy to reinstate license). |

## If you purchase a software you enter a contract?
Note, this is **NOT** the same as saying that the software license is a contract.

So,
> Can the software license be a contract?

Yes (not because you paid for software) but because of the **Terms & Conditions** incident to the software.

The **End-user License Agreement** (EULA) is license plus agreement. Some open-source softwares are also deemed contract.
